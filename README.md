## ABOUT THE THEME

Quoted from [the UN](https://www.un.org/en/observances/ending-violence-against-women-day), violence against women and girls (VAWG) as: “one of the most widespread, persistent, and devastating human rights violations in our world today. It remains largely unreported due to the impunity, silence, stigma, and shame surrounding it.” In general terms, it manifests itself in physical, sexual, and psychological forms, encompassing:

- intimate partner violence (battering, psychological abuse, marital rape, femicide);
- sexual violence and harassment (rape, forced sexual acts, unwanted sexual advances, child sexual abuse, forced marriage, street harassment, stalking, cyber-harassment);
- human trafficking (slavery, sexual exploitation);
- female genital mutilation; and
- child marriage. 

## ABOUT THE DATA
The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program exists to advance the global understanding of health and population trends in developing countries. “The DHS Program STATcompiler allows users to make custom tables based on thousands of demographic and health indicators across more than 90 countries.” 

The DHS Program aims to improve the collection, analysis, and dissemination of population, health, and nutrition data to enhance national and international policy-making.
The #MakeoverMonday data was taken from a survey of men and women in African, Asian, and South American countries, exploring the attitudes and perceived justifications given for committing acts of violence against women. The data also explores different sociodemographic groups that the respondents belong to, including: Education Level, Marital
status, Employment, and Age group.

Based on a representative sample of each country, the data reveals dramatic insights into some of the attitudes and assumptions that prevent progress in the global campaign to end violence against women and girls.

As you will see from the data, access to education appears to be the biggest game-changer when it comes to awareness that violence against women and girls can never be justified.
It is, therefore, critical that the countries where these views are widespread, prioritize public awareness campaigns, and access to education for women and girls, to communicate that violence against women and girls is never acceptable or justifiable. 

## What are shown in these infographics?
We will see which countries were impacted the most each year during 2010-2018. Then we will be able to see how the survey answers vary in different Socioeconomic groups in each country.

I have a special interest in the dataset for Bangladesh as I am a Bangladeshi by birth. I've tried to look closely if anything new can be uncovered.
